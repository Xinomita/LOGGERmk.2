# TO CONSIDER

Development notes, ideas, and features to implement later.

---

## Color System

**Users will need to be able to select a color to assign to a logging variable as a sort of tag - from a color library, like Google Calendar**

- Consider ~12 vibrant/neon colors for neo-brutalist aesthetic
- Color picker UI in variable configuration
- Each variable gets one color tag
- Colors sync across: slider accent, graph line, legend indicator
- Default palette suggestions based on common patterns

---

## Variable Range Configuration

**Need to think about how the ranges of each logging variable will be setup - tempting to make it manual, but idk... hmm**

- Manual: User sets min/max/baseline/step for each variable
- Auto: App suggests ranges based on variable type (weight, sleep, etc.)
- Hybrid: Smart defaults that user can override
- Consider: First-time setup wizard vs on-the-fly adjustment
- Dynamic ranges that adjust over time based on logged data?
